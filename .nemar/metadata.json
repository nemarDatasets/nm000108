  "title": "HySER: High-Density Surface Electromyogram Recordings",
  "description": "HySER is a high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) dataset comprising 256-channel recordings from 20 right-handed subjects performing hand gesture recognition and force control tasks across two sessions. The dataset includes simultaneous 5-finger force measurements and covers five task types: 34 discrete hand gestures, maximum voluntary contractions, single-finger and multi-finger force tracking, and random contractions. This resource supports research in motor control, gesture recognition, and electromyographic signal processing.",
  "methods_description": "HD-sEMG data were acquired using a Quattrocento system (OT Bioelettronica) at 2048 Hz sampling rate with 256 channels arranged in four 8×8 electrode arrays (5 mm × 2.8 mm elliptical, 10 mm inter-electrode spacing) placed on the right forearm extensors and flexors. Hardware filtering included 10 Hz high-pass (2nd order) and 500 Hz low-pass. Five-finger force data were recorded simultaneously at 100 Hz using force sensors. Subjects performed tasks across two sessions separated by 3-25 days.",
