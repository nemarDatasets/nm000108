  "title": "HySER: High-Density Surface Electromyogram Recordings",
  "description": "HySER is a high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) dataset comprising 256-channel recordings from 20 right-handed subjects performing five task types across two sessions. The dataset includes simultaneous 5-finger force recordings and covers discrete hand gesture recognition, maximum voluntary contractions, single-finger and multi-finger force tracking, and random contractions. This resource enables investigation of motor control, gesture recognition algorithms, and hand function assessment using advanced electrode array technology.",
  "methods_description": "HD-sEMG data were acquired using a Quattrocento system (OT Bioelettronica) at 2048 Hz sampling rate with 16-bit resolution and gain of 150. Four 8×8 gelled elliptical electrode arrays (5 mm × 2.8 mm spacing, 10 mm inter-electrode distance) were placed on the right forearm extensors and flexors (distal and proximal positions). Hardware filtering included 10 Hz high-pass (2nd order) and 500 Hz low-pass. Five-finger force data were recorded simultaneously at 100 Hz using force sensors. Reference electrode was placed at the olecranon with ground at the head of the ulna.",
