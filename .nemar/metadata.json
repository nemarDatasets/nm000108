  "description": "HySER is a high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) dataset comprising 256-channel recordings from 20 right-handed subjects performing hand gesture recognition and force control tasks across two sessions. The dataset includes simultaneous 5-finger force measurements and covers 34 discrete hand gestures, maximum voluntary contractions, single-finger and multi-finger force tracking, and random contractions. This resource supports research in motor control, gesture recognition, and electromyographic signal processing.",
  "methods_description": "HD-sEMG signals were recorded using a Quattrocento system (OT Bioelettronica) at 2048 Hz with 16-bit resolution from four 8×8 electrode arrays (256 channels total) placed on the flexor and extensor compartments of the right forearm. Electrodes were spaced 10 mm apart. Five-finger force data were acquired simultaneously at 100 Hz using force sensors. Subjects performed five task types: 34 discrete hand gestures (2 trials each with dynamic and maintenance phases), maximum voluntary contractions (2 per finger), single-finger force tracking (3 per finger), multi-finger force tracking (2 per combination), and random contractions (5 trials). Two sessions per subject were separated by 3-25 days.",
