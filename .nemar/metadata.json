  "title": "HySER: High-Density Surface Electromyogram Recordings",
  "description": "HySER is a high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) dataset comprising 256-channel recordings from 20 right-handed subjects performing five task types across two sessions. The dataset includes simultaneous 5-finger force measurements and covers discrete hand gesture recognition (34 gestures), maximum voluntary contractions, single-finger and multi-finger force tracking, and random contractions. This resource supports research in motor control, gesture recognition, and myoelectric signal processing.",
  "methods_description": "EMG data were acquired using a Quattrocento system (OT Bioelettronica) at 2048 Hz sampling rate with 16-bit resolution. Four 8×8 gelled electrode arrays (5 mm × 2.8 mm, 10 mm inter-electrode spacing) were placed on the right forearm extensors and flexors. Hardware filtering included 10 Hz high-pass (2nd order) and 500 Hz low-pass. Simultaneous 5-finger force recordings were obtained at 100 Hz using force sensors. Two sessions per subject were separated by 3-25 days.",
